* Shell Calendar


This is simple shell script that will generate HTML calendar with
pictures and optional list of notes.

Files you would need first:

- pictures - named `01.jpg` - `12.jpg`, one for every month
- picture descriptions [optional] - named `01.txt` - `12.txt`, one for every month
- optional lists of event

Creating events list
--------------------

Every event list is in separate file with list extension. It contains
optional style customization and list of events. Events could be
reoccurring every year or just specific to one year. Here is example list of
events:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
style=color: red;
01-01 New Year
12-25 Christmass
2016-03-28 Easter Monday
2017-04-17 Easter Monday
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage
-----

Just put all images in the directory with the script. Optionally put in their
description and your custom events lists. Then you can simply run the script
and the script would output html page with calendar for next year. You can
customize the start by exporting `START` variable. Something like this:


~START="2016-04-01" ./generate-calendar.sh > cal.html~


=./calendar.sh 2019-09-01 > cal.html=


Localisation
------------

To generate calendar, script uses `date` command to get names for the months
and days of the week. So prior running make sure you have correct locale set
(utf-8 one).
